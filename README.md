Much of the code in this implementation was borrowed from [Shivam Shrirao](https://github.com/ShivamShrirao). Huge thanks to him!

In three separate terminal windows run:

```
conda activate diffusers
huggingface-cli login
redis-server
```

```
conda activate diffusers
celery -A main.celery worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=1
```

```
conda activate diffusers
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then head over to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to run the api.

We've pre-configured a Brev environment that'll run Dreambooth out of the box! To get started, hit this [link](https://console.brev.dev/environment/new?setupRepo=https://github.com/brevdev/dreambooth&repo=https://github.com/brevdev/dreambooth&setupPath=.brev/setup.sh&instance=g5.2xlarge) to create a Brev environment.

## 1) Open your Dreambooth environment:

Open your new DreamBooth environment in VSCode:

```
brev open dreambooth --wait
```

If you don't have the Brev CLI installed, you can install it [here](https://brev.dev/docs/how-to/install-cli).

## 2) Upload training data:

1. Upload about 20 or so photos of someone you want to generate SD samples to the directory (you can drag and drop to vscode)
2. Inside `launch.sh` change instance_data_dir to point to your training data (line 12)
3. Then change the prompts you use on lines 13 and 22 of launch.sh e.g. "a photo of Jeremy" & "a photo of Jeremy wearing sunglasses"

## 3) Run the training job:

Setup your HuggingFace token:

```
huggingface-cli login
```

It'll prompt you to add your huggingface token (make sure you've accepted the Hugging Face [license agreement](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)).

Then run the training job :

```
sh launch.sh
```

(this should take about 5 minutes)

## 4) Generate samples:

To then do your own inference run:

```
conda activate diffusers
python inference.py "fine-tuned-model-output/800" "a photo of sks dog wearing sunglasses"
```
